# gcp-storage-class-match-notifier

Google Cloud Function that publishes messages to Pub/Sub when the metadata of a
GCS object changes and the object's storage class matches the given criteria â€” 
e.g., == `ARCHIVE`.

It has been used to notify other systems when GCS objects storage class changes
due to lifecycle rules being applied. Please notice that other metadata changes
will also trigger the function and publish messages to Pub/Sub if the storage
class matches the criteria.
